Hi, my name is Madi Welker and I'm a sophomore at [**Lehigh University**](http://www1.lehigh.edu/) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am majoring in Journalism with minors in Business, Entrepreneurship and Marketing and have a passion for writing, photography and sports finatic. Given the rapidly changing media landscape and the multitude of ways audiences connect with content today, I decided to declare a combination of minors.  

I am currently seeking internship opportunities in advertising and marketing. It's an exciting time in media and I believe the future is very much about being entrepreneurial in your approach - finding new and innovative ways to connect with your audience through multiple channels. I am interested in gaining experience where creative and initiative ideas meet a genuine enthusiasm that would allow me to apply classroom knowledge in a work environment.  The experience Iâ€™ve had at various internships working with big media platforms, major fashion companies and smaller public relations advisory firm, I have valuable experience and understanding of how to contribute to an organization as an intern.
